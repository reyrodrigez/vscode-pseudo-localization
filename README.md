# pseudo-localizer README

Pseudolocalization is a software testing method used for testing internationalization aspects of software. Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language.

__Example:__
```
Account Settings	[!!! Àççôûñţ Šéţţîñĝš !!!][1]
```

These specific alterations make the original words appear readable, but include the most problematic characteristics of the world's languages: varying length of text or characters, language direction, and so on.

__How to use__

1. select 
2. press `⇧⌘P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. search for `Pseudolocalize selected text`
